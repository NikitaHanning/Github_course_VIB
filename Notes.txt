Using Git & Github for collaborating on research projects:

1. Create a GitHub account and install Gitbash and Ungit. Then create a ssh-key with Gitbash and link it to your GitHub account. 
   For download links and detailled instructions, see the emails of the course.
2. Create a new folder that will become a repository.
3. Open Ungit via the command module ("ungit"). This is not a necessity, but creates a visual interface that makes the working process easier. 
4. In Ungit, set the path - at the top of the screen - to the correct destination folder. 
5. In Gitbash, go to the correct folder by using "cd *Documents/GitHub_course_VIB*".
6. In Gitbash, initiate the repository by using "git init".
7. In Ungit, refresh the path: you should now be able to see a repository and its files. 
8. In Gitbash, create an author identity using
	"git config --global user.email "nikita.hanning@gmail.com""
	"git config --global user.name "NikitaHanning""
9. In Gitbash, add files from the development area to the staging area
	"git add Notes.txt"
10. In Gitbash, commit the changes with a meaningful message
	"git commit -m "XXXXX""
11. In Ungit, you can now see a point on the timeline (first commit).




Commands:

git init		start a repository
git add			bring files to the staging area
git commit -m "xxx"	fix the changed documents to the timeline, with a meaningful 
			message (why was it changed? How does this address the issue?, Does
			the change have any effect? Are there limitations linked to the change? It
			is important to be descriptive!



Conceptual notes:

Git creates a timeline that allows us to save different versions of files, and trace back changes (or even go back to them).
Each version will be saved using a "commit". GitHub is a backup of the different timelines.

Git = timemachine
Repository = timeline
GitHub = backup for the timelines

There are 4 conceptual areas where you can work with git:
1) your personal computer
   --> Developing area: folder where the project is developed. This is where we will develop the project, e.g. our working files.
   --> Local repository: this is where the 'timeline' is. This is where you save snapshots that will document the timeline. 
   --> Staging area: a channel connecting the developing area and the local repository. 


In Ungit, you can commit changes without adding them to a staging area (simply by pushing the 'commit' button). This is useful, but
certain complex tasks cannot be done this way. Therefore, it is always good to be able to work with Gitbash itself, i.e. commands.
